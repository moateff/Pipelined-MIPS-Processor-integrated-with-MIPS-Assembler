# Pipelined MIPS Processor & Two-Pass Assembler

This project implements a **Pipelined MIPS Processor** along with a **Two Passes Assembler** to demonstrate the full flow from assembly code to execution.  

- **Pipelined MIPS Processor** – designed and implemented with support for instruction-level execution.  
- **Two Passes Assembler** – automatically translates MIPS assembly into machine code.  

## Tools Used
- [Icarus Verilog](http://iverilog.icarus.com/) – simulation  
- [GTKWave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/) – waveform visualization  
- Makefiles – workflow automation
